# CS 210 Project Two – Airgead Banking App

## Summary
In this project, the goal was to create an object orientated  application that took input form the user to calculate returns. The input values of inital investment, monthly deposits, interest rate and lastly, years for growth all were used to help forcast how much money was earned over time. I found that this project helped to strengthen my understanding of OOP and was enjoyable in creating an output that looked good and functional.

## Scenario
Congratulations! You have been hired as a junior developer at **Chada Tech**.  
Your first assignment is to collaborate with **Airgead Banking**, a client well known in the community for sponsoring schools and promoting fiscal responsibility.

Airgead Banking has partnered with a local high school to develop an **interactive system** that teaches students about financial responsibility—specifically **investing and the power of compound interest**.  

You will build an application that allows users to visualize how their investments grow over time.

## Directions
1. **Review Requirements**  
   - Read the *Airgead Banking App Functional Requirements* (see Supporting Materials).

2. **Plan Your Code**  
   - Create **pseudocode or a flowchart** to outline your program logic step-by-step.  
   - Guidelines:
     - Do not write actual code yet.
     - Use plain English statements, one per line.
     - Follow proper naming conventions.
     - Keep it simple and sequential.

3. **Develop the Application**  
   - Write an **object-oriented C++ program** that:
     - Meets all functional requirements.
     - Follows best practices from the *Airgead Banking Standards* document.
     - Includes **in-line comments** for clarity.
     - Uses secure and efficient coding practices.

4. **Package Your Work**  
   - Zip your project files (`.cpp`, `.h`, and any other components).
   - Include your pseudocode or flowchart.
   - Upload the zipped project to the submission area.
